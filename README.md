# mtg_card_API
Basic MtG Card Display from API

This is my first attempt at using an API to create an app. It is a work in progres - I will be constantly adding to it and tweaking aspects as I learn.

The ideas.js and bonusstyle.css were just my way of testing out layouts and other ideas without jeopardising my main code.
